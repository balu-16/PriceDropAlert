You'll need to create and add the following icon files here:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons will be used in various places in the browser extension:

- Extension management page
- Notifications

You can create simple icons using online tools like:

Or use free icon resources like:

Remember to use a design that's recognizable even at small sizes, like a price tag or a down arrow to represent price drops.
