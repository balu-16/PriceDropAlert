# 🛒 Price Drop Alert

A smart, frontend-only application that helps users **track product prices** from their favorite e-commerce platforms. Users can set a **target price**, and the app will **alert them visually** once the product's current price falls below the threshold. 

No backend. No database. Just pure React logic, persistent localStorage, and an intuitive UI for smarter shopping. 💸
